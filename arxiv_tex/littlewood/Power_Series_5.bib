	abstract = {We present a highly efficient yet accurate analytical approximation for the Green’s function of a Holstein polaron. It is obtained by summing all the self-energy diagrams, but with each self-energy diagram averaged over the momenta of its free propagators. The result becomes exact for both zero bandwidth and for zero electron-phonon coupling and is accurate everywhere in the parameter space. The resulting Green’s function satisfies exactly the first six spectral weight sum rules. All higher sum rules are satisfied with great accuracy, becoming asymptotically exact for coupling both much larger and much smaller than the free particle bandwidth. Comparison with existing numerical data also confirms this accuracy. We use this approximation to analyze in detail the redistribution of the spectral weight as the coupling strength varies.},

	abstract = {A complete numerical solution is given for the two-site polaron problem: electrons hopping between two adjacent diatomic molecules to which they couple via a charge-density–intramolecular-deformation interaction of strength α. As one enters the polaronic regime upon increasing α, the quasiparticle picture for the electrons breaks down. This is manifest in the appearance of a broad spectrum in the spectral functions due to (i) strong nonlinear mixing of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom and (ii) the intrinsic attractive interaction between small polarons leading to their instability towards pair formation. These effects, which are signatures of polarons, can be measured by photoemission spectroscopy for the electrons and are visible in the inelastic-neutron-scattering cross section for the phonons. A number of other measurable effects are discussed as a function of temperature: the anomalous temperature behavior of the vibrational energy of the molecules (resonant neutron absorption spectroscopy), the radial distribution function for the intramolecular distance showing fluctuations between two preferential distances (x-ray-absorption fine structure), and the mean-square displacements of the atoms in the molecules (Debye-Waller factor). Links with experiments on polaronic systems are made.},

However, a detailed theoretical description of plasmonic hot-carrier generation in real materials has remained incomplete. Here we report predictions for the prompt distributions of excited ‘hot’ electrons and holes generated by plasmon decay, before inelastic relaxation, using a quantized plasmon model with detailed electronic structure. We find that carrier energy distributions are sensitive to the electronic band structure of the metal: gold and copper produce holes hotter than electrons by 1–2 eV, while silver and aluminium distribute energies more equitably between electrons and holes. Momentum-direction distributions for hot carriers are anisotropic, dominated by the plasmon polarization for aluminium and by the crystal orientation for noble metals. We show that in thin metallic films intraband transitions can alter the carrier distributions, producing hotter electrons in gold, but interband transitions remain dominant.},

	abstract = {A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle. This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one electron missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter cases we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Fock equation involving a "Coulomb hole" and a static screened potential in the exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed. To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle energies E(k) and quasiparticle interactions f(k, k′). The very first approximation gives a good value for the magnitude of E(k). To estimate the derivative of E(k) we need both the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the specific heat, is found to differ from the free-particle value by only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metal-density region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for f. Besides the proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational principle and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle in this paper. The emphasis is on the development of a numerically manageable approximation scheme.},

	abstract = {The electron spectral function is calculated for a model including electron-phonon coupling to Einstein phonons. The spectrum is studied as a function of the electronic bandwidth and the energy ɛk of the level from which the electron is removed. A cumulant expansion is used for the time-dependent Green’s function, and the second- and fourth-order cumulants are studied. This approach is demonstrated to give accurate results for an exactly solvable two-level model with two electronic levels coupling to local phonons. For a one-band, infinite, three-dimensional model the cumulant expansion gives one satellite in the large-bandwidth limit. As the bandwidth is reduced, the spectrum calculated with the fourth-order cumulant develops multiple satellites, if ɛk is close to the Fermi energy EF, and as the bandwidth becomes small, results similar to the two-level model are obtained. If ɛk is more than a phonon energy below EF, the spectrum instead shows a very broad peak, due to the decay of the hole into a hole closer to EF and a phonon. If the spin degeneracy of the electrons is taken into account, the broadening due to the decay of a hole into a hole closer to EF and an electron-hole pair becomes important, even if ɛk is closer to EF than the phonon energy. The validity of Migdal’s theorem for A3C60 (A=K,Rb) is discussed. The intersubband electron-phonon coupling is appreciable for A3C60, and it may be argued that the effective bandwidth is large. It is shown that Migdal’s theorem is, nevertheless, not valid for A3C60.},

	abstract = {A detailed comparison of the surface sensitivity of x-ray photoemission spectroscopy for hard and soft x rays is presented and discussed. Electron scattering parameters and their energy dependence are given for Si and two Si spectra are analyzed: a MgKα (hν=1253.6eV) excited spectrum of the Si2p and 2s lines and a hard x-ray excited spectrum (hν=5925eV) of the Si1s line. The differential inelastic scattering characteristics for Si are extracted from reflection electron energy loss spectra taken at energies of 1500 and 4000eV. Using these scattering characteristics and electron mean free paths from the literature, simulated spectra are compared with experiment. The experimental spectra are deconvoluted to give the true intrinsic line shape corresponding to the theoretical collision statistics when interference effects between intrinsic and extrinsic scattering are neglected. The magnitude of interference effects cannot be assessed by our analysis. Within the (unknown) uncertainty introduced by neglecting interference effects, it is possible to determine the relative intensity of intrinsic and extrinsic excitations. In this way, it is found that in the case of the soft x-ray excited photoelectron spectrum of the shallower electronic shells (2p and 2s), intrinsic plasmon creation is rather weak, and the apparent asymmetric line shape of the spectrum might be interpreted as the fact that electron-hole pair creation dominates the intrinsic loss spectrum, while an alternative explanation in terms of surface core level shifted components is also proposed. For the deeper core electronic shell, probed with hard x rays, the opposite situation is observed: while intrinsic electron-hole pair creation was not observed, a strong contribution of intrinsic plasmon losses of about 30\% was seen.},

In particular, we study the dispersion and intensity of the plasmon satellites. We show that the satellite spectrum is much more sensitive to many details than the quasiparticle spectrum, which suggests that the experimental investigation of satellites could yield additional information beyond the usual studies of the band structure. In particular, a comparison to the homogeneous electron gas shows that the satellites are influenced by the crystal environment, although the crystal potential in sodium is weak. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the lattice constant is reflected in the position of the satellites. Details of the screening also play an important role; in particular, the contribution of transitions from 2s and 2p semicore levels influences the satellites, but not the quasiparticle. Moreover, inclusion of contributions to the screening beyond the random-phase approximation has an effect on the satellites. Finally, we elucidate the importance of the coupling of electrons and holes by comparing the results of the time-ordered and the retarded cumulant expansion approximations. Again, we find small but noticeable differences. Since all the small effects add up, our most advanced calculation yields a satellite position which is improved with respect to previous calculations by almost 1 eV. This stresses the fact that the calculation of satellites is much more delicate than the calculation of a quasiparticle band structure.},

These motions typically unfold on a subfemtosecond scale and have eluded real-time access until now. Attosecond spectroscopy (an attosecond is 10−18 seconds), first applied to tracking electronic transitions from one quantum state to another, has now been extended to follow the hyperfast (subfemtosecond) motion of electron wavepackets in the valence shell — the bond-forming electrons — of krypton ions. This first proof-of-principle demonstration uses a simple system, but the expectation is that attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of this type will ultimately reveal the elementary electron motions in molecules and solid-state materials that determine physical, chemical and biological properties.},

	abstract = {We use first-principles methods to study doped strong ferroelectrics (taking BaTiO3 as a prototype). Here, we find a strong coupling between itinerant electrons and soft polar phonons in doped BaTiO3, contrary to Anderson/Blount’s weakly coupled electron mechanism for "ferroelectric-like metals”. As a consequence, across a polar-to-centrosymmetric phase transition in doped BaTiO3, the total electron-phonon coupling is increased to about 0.6 around the critical concentration, which is sufficient to induce phonon-mediated superconductivity of about 2 K. Lowering the crystal symmetry of doped BaTiO3 by imposing epitaxial strain can further increase the superconducting temperature via a sizable coupling between itinerant electrons and acoustic phonons. Our work demonstrates a viable approach to modulating electron-phonon coupling and inducing phonon-mediated superconductivity in doped strong ferroelectrics and potentially in polar metals. Our results also show that the weakly coupled electron mechanism for "ferroelectric-like metals” is not necessarily present in doped strong ferroelectrics.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) crystals have emerged as a class of materials with tunable carrier density1. Carrier doping to 2D semiconductors can be used to modulate many-body interactions2 and to explore novel composite particles. The Holstein polaron is a small composite particle of an electron that carries a cloud of self-induced lattice deformation (or phonons)3–5, which has been proposed to play a key role in high-temperature superconductivity6 and carrier mobility in devices7. Here we report the discovery of Holstein polarons in a surface-doped layered semiconductor, MoS2, in which a puzzling 2D superconducting dome with the critical temperature of 12 K was found recently8–11. Using a high-resolution band mapping of charge carriers, we found strong band renormalizations collectively identified as a hitherto unobserved spectral function of Holstein polarons12–18. The short-range nature of electron–phonon (e–ph) coupling in MoS2 can be explained by its valley degeneracy, which enables strong intervalley coupling mediated by acoustic phonons. The coupling strength is found to increase gradually along the superconducting dome up to the intermediate regime, which suggests a bipolaronic pairing in the 2D superconductivity.},

Optical absorption measurements extending into near infrared show two low-energy absorption features at low doping ratios and an additional peak at a higher energy of ∼2.2 eV that disappears with increasing doping ratios. A gap state (i.e., polaronic state) close to the Fermi level and a significantly destabilized highest valence band appear in the experimentally measured ultraviolet photoelectron spectra. These experimental results are interpreted by the TD-DFT calculations, which show that the lower energy peaks originate from the excitation from polaronic states to the conduction band, while the higher energy peak mainly originates from the destabilized valence band to conduction band transitions and only appears at low doping ratios (cred ≤ 50\%, 0.5 potassium atom per fluorene monomer). The DFT calculations further indicate that polaron pairs rather than bipolarons are preferentially formed at high doping ratios. Comparing the results of doped glassy and β-phase films, we find that the ordered segments in the β-phase film disappear due to the dopant (potassium) insertion, resulting in a similar polaronic structure.},

However the recent observation of a similar superconducting gap in single-unit-cell FeSe/STO(110) raised the question of whether a similar mechanism applies. Here we report the ARPES study of the electronic structure of FeSe/STO(110). Similar to the results in FeSe/STO(001), clear replica bands are observed. We also present a comparative study of STO(001) and STO(110) bare surfaces, and observe similar replica bands separated by approximately the same energy, indicating this coupling is a generic feature of the STO surfaces and interfaces.

	abstract = {In addition to the record high superconducting transition temperature (T\{sub c\}), high temperature cuprate superconductors are characterized by their unusual superconducting properties below T\{sub c\}, and anomalous normal state properties above T\{sub c\}. In the superconducting state, although it has long been realized that superconductivity still involves Cooper pairs, as in the traditional BCS theory, the experimentally determined d-wave pairing is different from the usual s-wave pairing found in conventional superconductors. The identification of the pairing mechanism in cuprate superconductors remains an outstanding issue. The normal state properties, particularly in the underdoped region, have been found to be at odd with conventional metals which is usually described by Fermi liquid theory; instead, the normal state at optimal doping fits better with the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology. Most notable is the observation of the pseudogap state in the underdoped region above T\{sub c\}. As in other strongly correlated electrons systems, these unusual properties stem from the interplay between electronic, magnetic, lattice and orbital degrees of freedom. Understanding the microscopic process involved in these materials and the interaction of electrons with other entities is essential to understand the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity. Since the discovery of high-T\{sub c\} superconductivity in cuprates, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has provided key experimental insights in revealing the electronic structure of high temperature superconductors. These include, among others, the earliest identification of dispersion and a large Fermi surface, an anisotropic superconducting gap suggestive of a d-wave order parameter, and an observation of the pseudogap in underdoped samples. In the mean time, this technique itself has experienced a dramatic improvement in its energy and momentum resolutions, leading to a series of new discoveries not thought possible only a decade ago. This revolution of the ARPES technique and its scientific impact result from dramatic advances in four essential components: instrumental resolution and efficiency, sample manipulation, high quality samples and well-matched scientific issues. The purpose of this treatise is to go through the prominent results obtained from ARPES on cuprate superconductors. Because there have been a number of recent reviews on the electronic structures of high-T\{sub c\} materials, we will mainly present the latest results not covered previously, with a special attention given on the electron-phonon interaction in cuprate superconductors. What has emerged is rich information about the anomalous electron-phonon interaction well beyond the traditional views of the subject. It exhibits strong doping, momentum and phonon symmetry dependence, and shows complex interplay with the strong electron-electron interaction in these materials. ARPES experiments have been instrumental in identifying the electronic structure, observing and detailing the electron-phonon mode coupling behavior, and mapping the doping evolution of the high-T\{sub c\} cuprates. The spectra evolve from the strongly coupled, polaronic spectra seen in underdoped cuprates to the Migdal-Eliashberg like spectra seen in the optimally and overdoped cuprates. In addition to the marked doping dependence, the cuprates exhibit pronounced anisotropy with direction in the Brillouin zone: sharp quasiparticles along the nodal direction that broaden significantly in the anti-nodal region of the underdoped cuprates, an anisotropic electron-phonon coupling vertex for particular modes identified in the optimal and overdoped compounds, and preferential scattering across the two parallel pieces of Fermi surface in the antinodal region for all doping levels. This also contributes to the pseudogap effect. To the extent that the Migdal-Eliashberg picture applies, the spectra of the cuprates bear resemblance to that seen in established strongly coupled electron-phonon superconductors such as Pb. On the other hand, the cuprates deviate from this conventional picture. In the underdoped regime, the carriers are best understood as small polarons in an antiferromagnetic, highly electron correlated background, while the doped compounds require an anisotropic electron-phonon vertex to detail the prominent mode coupling signatures in the superconducting state. Electronic vertex corrections to the electron-phonon coupling furthermore may enhance, and for certain phonons, determine, the anisotropy of the electron-phonon coupling. A consistent picture emerges of the cuprates, combining strong, anisotropic electron-phonon coupling, particular phonon modes that could give rise to such a coupling, and an electron-electron interaction modifying the el-ph vertex.},

	abstract = {The last decade witnessed significant progress in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and its applications. Today, ARPES experiments with 2-meV energy resolution and 0.2° angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. These technological advances and the improved sample quality have enabled ARPES to emerge as a leading tool in the investigation of the high-Tc superconductors. This paper reviews the most recent ARPES results on the cuprate superconductors and their insulating parent and sister compounds, with the purpose of providing an updated summary of the extensive literature. The low-energy excitations are discussed with emphasis on some of the most relevant issues, such as the Fermi surface and remnant Fermi surface, the superconducting gap, the pseudogap and d-wave-like dispersion, evidence of electronic inhomogeneity and nanoscale phase separation, the emergence of coherent quasiparticles through the superconducting transition, and many-body effects in the one-particle spectral function due to the interaction of the charge with magnetic and/or lattice degrees of freedom. Given the dynamic nature of the field, we chose to focus mainly on reviewing the experimental data, as on the experimental side a general consensus has been reached, whereas interpretations and related theoretical models can vary significantly. The first part of the paper introduces photoemission spectroscopy in the context of strongly interacting systems, along with an update on the state-of-the-art instrumentation. The second part provides an overview of the scientific issues relevant to the investigation of the low-energy electronic structure by ARPES. The rest of the paper is devoted to the experimental results from the cuprates, and the discussion is organized along conceptual lines: normal-state electronic structure, interlayer interaction, superconducting gap, coherent superconducting peak, pseudogap, electron self-energy, and collective modes. Within each topic, ARPES data from the various copper oxides are presented.},

Thus, the underlying physical mechanism is of great scientific and technological importance and is one of the hottest topics in the area of plasmonic photocatalysts. In this review, we examine the very recent advances in understanding the energy transfer process in plasmonic photocatalytic composites, describing both the theoretical basis of this process and experimental demonstrations. The factors that affect the energy transfer efficiencies and how to improve the efficiencies to yield better photocatalytic performance are also discussed. Furthermore, comparisons are made between the various energy transfer processes, emphasizing their limitations/benefits for efficient operation of plasmonic photocatalysts.},

	abstract = {We develop a first-principles approach based on many-body perturbation theory to investigate the effects of the interaction between electrons and carrier plasmons on the electronic properties of highly doped semiconductors and oxides. Through the evaluation of the electron self-energy, we account simultaneously for electron-plasmon and electron-phonon coupling in theoretical calculations of angle-resolved photoemission spectra, electron linewidths, and relaxation times. We apply this methodology to electron-doped anatase TiO2 as an illustrative example. The simulated spectra indicate that electron-plasmon coupling in TiO2 underpins the formation of satellites at energies comparable to those of polaronic spectral features. At variance with phonons, however, the energy of plasmons and their spectral fingerprints depends strongly on the carrier concentration, revealing a complex interplay between plasmon and phonon satellites. The electron-plasmon interaction accounts for approximately 40\% of the total electron-boson interaction strength, and it is key to improve the agreement with measured quasiparticle spectra.},

	abstract = {The role of the crystal lattice for the electronic properties of cuprates and other high-temperature superconductors remains controversial despite decades of theoretical and experimental efforts. While the paradigm of strong electronic correlations suggests a purely electronic mechanism behind the insulator-to-metal transition, recently the mutual enhancement of the electron–electron and the electron–phonon interaction and its relevance to the formation of the ordered phases have also been emphasized. Here, we combine polarization-resolved ultrafast optical spectroscopy and state-of-the-art dynamical mean-field theory to show the importance of the crystal lattice in the breakdown of the correlated insulating state in an archetypal undoped cuprate. We identify signatures of electron–phonon coupling to specific fully symmetric optical modes during the buildup of a three-dimensional (3D) metallic state that follows charge photodoping. Calculations for coherently displaced crystal structures along the relevant phonon coordinates indicate that the insulating state is remarkably unstable toward metallization despite the seemingly large charge-transfer energy scale. This hitherto unobserved insulator-to-metal transition mediated by fully symmetric lattice modes can find extensive application in a plethora of correlated solids.},

	abstract = {In organic field-effect transistors (FETs), charges move near the surface of an organic semiconductor, at the interface with a dielectric. In the past, the nature of the microscopic motion of charge carriers—which determines the device performance—has been related to the quality of the organic semiconductor. Recently, it was discovered that the nearby dielectric also has an unexpectedly strong influence. The mechanisms responsible for this influence are not understood. To investigate these mechanisms, we have studied transport through organic single-crystal FETs with different gate insulators. We find that the temperature dependence of the mobility evolves from metallic-like to insulating-like with increasing dielectric constant of the insulator. The phenomenon is accounted for by a two-dimensional Fröhlich polaron model that quantitatively describes our observations and shows that increasing the dielectric polarizability results in a crossover from the weak to the strong polaronic coupling regime. This represents a considerable step forward in our understanding of transport through organic transistors, and identifies a microscopic physical process with a large influence on device performance.},

	abstract = {The perovskite oxide SrTiO3 is an n-type semiconductor, which exhibits superconductivity at low temperatures even though there are extraordinarily few electrons. In most materials, with so few electrons it becomes difficult to pair them into a macroscopic superconducting ground state. This regime is also unusual in that most theories of superconductivity rely on electrons that are much faster than their coupling (typically lattice vibrations or phonons). By using techniques in which tunneling junctions are engineered with atomic recision, we are able to probe the electronic structure of this material. The experiments indicate a large discrepancy between the electron{\textendash}phonon coupling strength and the superconducting properties. This places SrTiO3, a host material for a variety of exotic quantum phases (i.e., in FeSe/SrTiO3, LaAlO3/SrTiO3), in a unique regime of superconductivity.The nature of superconductivity in the dilute semiconductor SrTiO3 has remained an open question for more than 50 y. The extremely low carrier densities (1018{\textendash}1020 cm-3) at which superconductivity occurs suggest an unconventional origin of superconductivity outside of the adiabatic limit on which the Bardeen{\textendash}Cooper{\textendash}Schrieffer (BCS) and Migdal{\textendash}Eliashberg (ME) theories are based. We take advantage of a newly developed method for engineering band alignments at oxide interfaces and access the electronic structure of Nb-doped SrTiO3, using high-resolution tunneling spectroscopy. We observe strong coupling to the highest-energy longitudinal optic (LO) phonon branch and estimate the doping evolution of the dimensionless electron{\textendash}phonon interaction strength (��). Upon cooling below the superconducting transition temperature (����), we observe a single superconducting gap corresponding to the weak-coupling limit of BCS theory, indicating an order of magnitude smaller coupling (��������≈0.1). These results suggest that despite the strong normal state interaction with electrons, the highest LO phonon does not provide a dominant contribution to pairing. They further demonstrate that SrTiO3 is an ideal system to probe superconductivity over a wide range of carrier density, adiabatic parameter, and electron{\textendash}phonon coupling strength.},
