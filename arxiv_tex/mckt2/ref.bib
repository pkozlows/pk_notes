    abstract = {In this work, we systematically investigate the mechanisms underlying the rate modification of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. We employ a symmetric double-well description of the molecular potential energy surface and a numerically exact open quantum system approach—the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space with a matrix product state solver. Our results predict the existence of multiple peaks in the photon frequency-dependent rate profile for a strongly anharmonic molecular system with multiple vibrational transition energies. The emergence of a new peak in the rate profile is attributed to the opening of an intramolecular reaction pathway, energetically fueled by the cavity photon bath through a resonant cavity mode. The peak intensity is determined jointly by kinetic factors. Going beyond the single-molecule limit, we examine the effects of the collective coupling of two molecules to the cavity. We find that when two identical molecules are simultaneously coupled to the same resonant cavity mode, the reaction rate is further increased. This additional increase is associated with the activation of a cavity-induced intermolecular reaction channel. Furthermore, the rate modification due to these cavity-promoted reaction pathways remains unaffected, regardless of whether the molecular dipole moments are aligned in the same or opposite direction as the light polarization.},

In this Communication, we approach this problem by employing the hierarchical equation of motion method to simulate model systems where the vibrational modes are dissipative. It is found that, as the friction becomes smaller, the charge carrier mobility increases significantly and a friction-free limit cannot be obtained. The current autocorrelation functions are also calculated for the friction-free Holstein model, and converged results cannot be obtained with an increase in the number of sites. Based on these observations, we conclude that a finite mobility cannot be defined for the standard Holstein model in the parameter regime explored in this work.},

    abstract = { We study the Förster resonant energy transfer rate, absorption and emission spectra in multichromophoric systems. The multichromophoric Förster theory (MCFT) is determined from an overlap integral of generalized matrices related to the donor’s emission and acceptor’s absorption spectra, which are obtained via a full 2nd-order cumulant expansion technique developed in this work. We calculate the spectra and MCFT rate for both localized and delocalized systems, and calibrate the analytical 2nd-order cumulant expansion with the exact stochastic path integral method. We present three essential findings: (i) The role of the initial entanglement between the donor and its bath is found to be crucial in both the emission spectrum and the MCFT rate. (ii) The absorption spectra obtained by the cumulant expansion method are nearly identical to the exact spectra for both localized and delocalized systems, even when the system-bath coupling is far from the perturbative regime. (iii) For the emission spectra, the cumulant expansion can give reliable results for localized systems, but fail to provide reliable spectra of the high-lying excited states of a delocalized system, when the system-bath coupling is large and the thermal energy is small. This paper also provides a simple golden-rule derivation of the MCFT, reviews existing methods, and motivates further developments in the subsequent papers. },

    abstract = {This book treats the central physical concepts and mathematical techniques used to investigate the dynamics of open quantum systems. To provide a self-contained presentation, the text begins with a survey of classical probability theory and with an introduction to the foundations of quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on its statistical interpretation and on the formulation of generalized measurement theory through quantum operations and effects. The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes, and completely positive dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and condensed matter theory are derived and applied to the study of many examples. Special attention is paid to the Markovian and non-Markovian theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process, and to the experimental observation of decohering electromagnetic field states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics. The fundamentals of the treatment of non-Markovian quantum processes in open systems are developed on the basis of various mathematical techniques, such as projection superoperator methods and influence functional techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and the density matrix theory of relativistic quantum electrodynamics.},

We extend the reduced hierarchy equations of motion approach to include both overdamped Drude and underdamped Brownian modes. While the overdamped mode describes the inhomogeneity of a system in the slow modulation limit, the underdamped mode expresses the primary vibrational mode coupled with the electronic states. We outline a procedure for calculating 2D correlation spectrum that incorporates the ET processes. The present approach has the capability of dealing with system-bath coherence under an external perturbation, which is important to calculate nonlinear response functions for non-Markovian noise. The calculated 2D spectrum exhibits the effects of the ET processes through the presence of ET transition peaks along the Ω1 axis, as well as the decay of echo signals.},

Quasi‐adiabatic propagators constructed numerically allow convergence of the path integral with large time increments. Integration of the harmonic bath leads to path integral expressions that incorporate the exact dynamics of the quantum particle along the adiabatic path, with an influence functional that describes nonadiabatic corrections. The resulting quasi‐adiabatic propagator path integral is evaluated by efficient system‐specific quadratures in most regimes of parameter space, although some cases are handled by grid Monte Carlo sampling. Exploiting the finite span of nonlocal influence functional interactions characteristic of broad condensed phase spectra leads to an iterative scheme for calculating the path integral over arbitrary time lengths. No uncontrolled approximations are introduced, and the resulting methodology converges to the exact quantum result with modest amounts of computational power. Applications to tunneling dynamics in the condensed phase are described.},

    abstract = {A generalized quantum master equation theory that governs the exact, nonperturbative quantum dissipation and quantum transport is formulated in terms of hierarchically coupled equations of motion for an arbitrary electronic system in contact with electrodes under either a stationary or a nonstationary electrochemical potential bias. The theoretical construction starts with the influence functional in path integral, in which the electron creation and annihilation operators are Grassmann variables. Time derivatives on the influence functionals are then performed in a hierarchical manner. Both the multiple-frequency dispersion and the non-Markovian reservoir parametrization schemes are considered for the desired hierarchy construction. The resulting hierarchical equations of motion formalism is in principle exact and applicable to arbitrary electronic systems, including Coulomb interactions, under the influence of arbitrary time-dependent applied bias voltage and external fields. Both the conventional quantum master equation and the real-time diagrammatic formalism of Schön and co-workers can be readily obtained at well defined limits of the present theory. We also show that for a noninteracting electron system, the present hierarchical equations of motion formalism terminates at the second tier exactly, and the Landuer–Büttiker transport current expression is recovered. The present theory renders an exact and numerically tractable tool to evaluate various transient and stationary quantum transport properties of many-electron systems, together with the involving nonperturbative dissipative dynamics.},

The resulting equations of motion are shown to be equivalent to describing the electronic degrees of freedom by the time‐dependent Schrödinger equation, the time dependence arising from the classical motion of the nuclei, the trajectory of which is determined by the quantum mechanical average (i.e., Ehrenfest) force on the nuclei. Quantizing the system via classical S‐matrix theory is shown to provide a dynamically consistent description of nonadiabatic collision processes; i.e., different electronic transitions have different heavy particle trajectories and, for example, the total energy of the electronic and heavy particle degrees of freedom is conserved. Application of this classical model for the electronic degrees of freedom (plus classical S‐matrix theory) to the two‐state model problem shows that the approach provides a good description of the electronic dynamics.},

(1.1)] can be expressed, without approximation, in the same form as the linearized approximation of the semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR), or classical Wigner model, for the correlation function [cf. Eq. (2.1)], i.e., as a phase space average (over initial conditions for trajectories) of the Wigner functions corresponding to the two operators. The difference is that the trajectories involved in the LSC-IVR evolve classically, i.e., according to the classical equations of motion, while in the exact theory they evolve according to generalized equations of motion that are derived here. Approximations to the exact equations of motion are then introduced to achieve practical methods that are applicable to complex (i.e., large) molecular systems. Four such methods are proposed in the paper—the full Wigner dynamics (full WD) and the second order WD based on “Wigner trajectories” [H. W. Lee and M. D. Scully, J. Chem. Phys. 77, 4604 (1982)] and the full Donoso-Martens dynamics (full DMD) and the second order DMD based on “Donoso-Martens trajectories” [A. Donoso and C. C. Martens, Phys. Rev. Lett. 8722, 223202 (2001)]—all of which can be viewed as generalizations of the original LSC-IVR method. Numerical tests of the four versions of this new approach are made for two anharmonic model problems, and for each the momentum autocorrelation function (i.e., operators linear in coordinate or momentum operators) and the force autocorrelation function (nonlinear operators) have been calculated. These four new approximate treatments are indeed seen to be significant improvements to the original LSC-IVR approximation.},

If a switch occurs, the component of velocity in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector is adjusted to conserve energy. The procedure allows electronic transitions to occur anywhere among any number of coupled states, governed by the quantum mechanical probabilities. The method is tested against accurate quantal calculations for three one‐dimensional, two‐state models, two of which have been specifically designed to challenge any such mixed classical–quantal dynamical theory.

    abstract = {We present a nonadiabatic classical-trajectory approach that offers the best of both worlds between fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) and quasiclassical mapping dynamics. This mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) propagates the nuclei on the active adiabatic potential-energy surface, such as in FSSH. However, unlike in FSSH, transitions between active surfaces are deterministic and occur when the electronic mapping variables evolve between specified regions of the electronic phase space. This guarantees internal consistency between the active surface and the electronic degrees of freedom throughout the dynamics. MASH is rigorously derivable from exact quantum mechanics as a limit of the quantum–classical Liouville equation (QCLE), leading to a unique prescription for momentum rescaling and frustrated hops. Hence, a quantum-jump procedure can, in principle, be used to systematically converge the accuracy of the results to that of the QCLE. This jump procedure also provides a rigorous framework for deriving approximate decoherence corrections similar to those proposed for FSSH. We apply MASH to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics in various model systems and show that it consistently produces more accurate results than FSSH at a comparable computational cost.},

This is done by, first, rewriting the equation of motion in a generalized form of the Langevin equation in the stochastic theory of Brownian motion and then, either studying the average evolution of a non-equilibrium system or calculating the linear response function to a mechanical perturbation. (1) An expression is obtained for the damping function φ(t), the real part of whose Laplace transform gives the damping constnat of collective motion. (2) A general equation of motion for a set of dynamical variables At) is derived, which takes the form  where  is a frequency matrix determining the collective
oscillation of A(t). The quantity f(t) consists of those terms

dependent on the other degrees-of-freedom explicitly, and its
time-correlation function is connected with the damping function
φ(t) by (f(t1), f(t2)*) = φ(t1 − t2)·(A, A*). (3) An expression is obtained for the linear after-effect function to thermal disturbances such as temperature gradient and strain tensor. Both the conjugate fluxes and the time dependence differ from those of the mechanical response function. The conjugate fluxes are random parts of the fluxes of the state variables, thus depending on temperature. (4) The difference in the time dependence arises from a special property of the time evolution of f(t) and ensures that the damping function and the thermal after-effect function are determined by the microscopic processes in strong contrast to the mechanical response function. The difficulty of the plateau value problem in the previous theories of Brownian motion and transport coefficients is thus removed. (5) The theory is illustrated by dealing with the motion of inhomogeneous magnetization in ferromagnets and the Brownian motion of the collective coordinates of fluids.

In the new GME, time derivatives of population on each quantum state of the molecule, as well as the tunneling current, are calculated as the convolution of time non-local memory kernels with populations on all system states. The non-Markovian memory kernels are obtained by combining the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method and a previous derived Dyson relation for the exact kernel. A perturbative expansion of these memory kernels is then calculated using the extended HEOM developed in our previous work [M. Xu et al., J. Chem. Phys. 146, 064102 (2017)]. By using the resonant level model and the Anderson impurity model, we study properties of the exact memory kernels and analyze convergence properties of their perturbative expansions with respect to the system–bath coupling strength and the electron–electron repulsive energy. It is found that exact memory kernels calculated from HEOM exhibit short memory times and decay faster than the population and current dynamics. The high order perturbation expansion of the memory kernels can give converged results in certain parameter regimes. The Padé and Landau–Zener resummation schemes are also found to give improved results over low order perturbation theory.},

In this equation, a memory kernel superoperator accounts for the influence of the bath on the dynamics of the system. In a previous paper [Q. Shi and E. Geva, J. Chem. Phys. 119, 12045 (2003)] we proposed a new approach to calculating the memory kernel, in the case of arbitrary system-bath coupling. Within this approach, the memory kernel is obtained by solving a set of two integral equations, which requires a new type of two-time system-dependent bath correlation functions as input. In the present paper, we consider the application of the linearized semiclassical (LSC) approximation for calculating those correlation functions, and subsequently the memory kernel. The new approach is tested on a benchmark spin-boson model. Application of the LSC approximation for calculating the relatively short-lived memory kernel, followed by a numerically exact solution of the GQME, is found to provide an accurate description of the relaxation dynamics. The success of the proposed LSC–GQME methodology is contrasted with the failure of both the direct application of the LSC approximation and the weak coupling treatment to provide an accurate description of the dynamics, for the same model, except at very short times. The feasibility of the new methodology to anharmonic systems is also demonstrated in the case of a two level system coupled to a chain of Lennard–Jones atoms.},

For a large number of problems, it has been shown that exact and approximate quantum dynamics methods can be made dramatically more efficient, and in the latter case more accurate, by proceeding via the GQME formalism. However, there are many situations where utilizing the GQME approach with an approximate method has been observed to return the same dynamics as using that method directly. Here, for systems both in and out of equilibrium, we provide a more detailed understanding of the conditions under which using an approximate method can yield benefits when combined with the GQME formalism. In particular, we demonstrate the necessary manipulations, which are satisfied by exact quantum dynamics, that are required to recast the memory kernel in a form that can be analytically shown to yield the same result as a direct application of the dynamics regardless of the approximation used. By considering the connections between these forms of the kernel, we derive the conditions that approximate methods must satisfy if they are to offer different results when used in conjunction with the GQME formalism. These analytical results thus provide new insights as to when proceeding via the GQME approach can be used to improve the accuracy of simulations.},

Via comparison with numerically exact results for the correlation function Czz(t)=Re⟨σz(0)σz(t)⟩, we show that the current scheme affords remarkable boosts in accuracy and efficiency over bare Ehrenfest dynamics.

Characteristics of the exact memory kernels, as well as the transition rate constants within the Markovian approximation, are then analyzed for different sets of parameters ranging from the hopping to bandlike transport regimes. It is shown that, despite the memory effect of the exact kernels, the Markovian approximation to the exact GME can reproduce the diffusion constants accurately. We also investigate the validity of the second and fourth order perturbation theories with respect to the electronic coupling constant in calculating the rate constants and the diffusion constant. It is found that, due to the cancellation of errors, the second order diffusion constant gives a reasonable estimate of the exact one within a wide range of electronic coupling constants.},

     abstract = {The dynamics of delocalized excitons in light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) can be investigated using different experimental techniques, and transient absorption (TA)     spectroscopy is one of the most valuable methods for this purpose. A careful interpretation of TA spectra is essential for the clarification of excitation energy transfer (EET)         processes occurring during light-harvesting. However, even in the simplest LHCs, a physical model is needed to interpret transient spectra as the number of EET processes occurring at   the same time is very large to be disentangled from measurements alone. Physical EET models are commonly built by fittings of the microscopic exciton Hamiltonians and exciton-          vibrational parameters, an approach that can lead to biases. Here, we present a first-principles strategy to simulate EET and transient absorption spectra in LHCs, combining molecular  dynamics and accurate multiscale quantum chemical calculations to obtain an independent estimate of the excitonic structure of the complex. The microscopic parameters thus obtained     are then used in EET simulations to obtain the population dynamics and the related spectroscopic signature. We apply this approach to the CP29 minor antenna complex of plants for       which we follow the EET dynamics and transient spectra after excitation in the chlorophyll b region. Our calculations reproduce all the main features observed in the transient          absorption spectra and provide independent insight on the excited-state dynamics of CP29. The approach presented here lays the groundwork for the accurate simulation of EET and         unbiased interpretation of transient spectra in multichromophoric systems.},

Particularly when    dealing with complex systems, the huge computational cost will largely limit the applicability of these methods. In this work, we investigate the usage of dynamic mode decomposition    (DMD) to evaluate the rate kernels in quantum rate processes. DMD is a data-driven model reduction technique that characterizes the rate kernels using snapshots collected from a small  time window, allowing us to predict the long-term behaviors with only a limited number of samples. Our investigations show that whether the external field is involved or not, the DMD   can give accurate prediction of the result compared with the traditional propagations, and simultaneously reduce the required computational cost.},

In this work, we address the key issues toward the solutions to the lowest nonlinear environment, a harmonic bath coupled both linearly and quadratically with an arbitrary system. To determine the bath coupling descriptors, we propose a physical mapping scheme, together with the prescription reference invariance requirement. We then adopt a recently developed dissipaton equation of motion theory [R. X. Xu et al., Chin. J. Chem. Phys. 30, 395 (2017)], with the underlying statistical quasi-particle (“dissipaton”) algebra being extended to the quadratic bath coupling.

    abstract = {We consider a proton transfer (PT) system described by a proton transfer reaction (PTR) coordinate and a rate promoting vibrational (RPV) coordinate interacting with a non-Markovian heat bath. While dynamics of PT processes has been widely discussed using two-dimensional potential energy surfaces, the role of the heat bath, in particular, in a realistic form of the system–bath interaction has not been well explored. Previous studies are largely based on a one-dimensional model and linear-linear system–bath interaction. In the present study, we introduce an exponential-linear (EL) system–bath interaction, which is derived from the analysis of a PTR–RPV system in a realistic situation. This interaction mainly causes vibrational dephasing in the PTR mode and population relaxation in the RPV mode. Numerical simulations were carried out using the hierarchical equations of motion approach. We analyze the role of the heat bath interaction in the chemical reaction rate as a function of the system–bath coupling strength at different temperatures and for different values of the bath correlation time. A prominent feature of the present result is that while the reaction rate predicted from classical and quantum Kramers theory increases as the temperature increases, the present EL interaction model exhibits opposite temperature dependence. The Kramers turn-over profile of the reaction rate as a function of the system–bath coupling is also suppressed in the present EL model, turning into a plateau-like curve for larger system–bath interaction strength. Such features arise from the interplay of the vibrational dephasing process in the PTR mode and the population relaxation process in the RPV mode.},

    abstract = {Fermi’s golden rule (FGR) offers an empirical framework for understanding the dynamics of spin–lattice relaxation in magnetic molecules, encompassing mechanisms like direct (one-phonon) and Raman (two-phonon) processes. These principles effectively model experimental longitudinal relaxation rates, denoted as T1−1. However, under scenarios of increased coupling strength and nonlinear spin–lattice interactions, FGR’s applicability may diminish. This paper numerically evaluates the exact spin–lattice relaxation rate kernels, employing the extended dissipaton equation of motion formalism. Our calculations reveal that when quadratic spin–lattice coupling is considered, the rate kernels exhibit a free induction decay-like feature, and the damping rates depend on the interaction strength. We observe that the temperature dependence predicted by FGR significantly deviates from the exact results since FGR ignores the higher order effects and the non-Markovian nature of spin–lattice relaxation. Our methods can be easily extended to study other systems with nonlinear spin–lattice interactions and provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of T1 in molecular qubits when the coupling is strong.},
