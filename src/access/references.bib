  abstract = "We present a scalable single-particle framework to treat
              electronic correlation in molecules and materials motivated by
              Green's function theory. We derive a size-extensive
              Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory from the single-particle
              Green's function by introducing the Goldstone self-energy. This
              new ground state correlation energy, referred to as Quasi-Particle
              MP2 theory (QPMP2), avoids the characteristic divergences present
              in both second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory and
              Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles within the strongly correlated
              regime. We show that the exact ground state energy and properties
              of the Hubbard dimer are reproduced by QPMP2 and demonstrate the
              advantages of the approach for larger Hubbard models where the
              metal-to-insulator transition is qualitatively reproduced,
              contrasting with the complete failure of traditional methods. We
              apply this formalism to characteristic strongly correlated
              molecular systems and show that QPMP2 provides an efficient,
              size-consistent regularization of MP2.",

               gaps of typical semiconductors and insulators are presented for
               Hartree–Fock and second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory
               (MP2). We find that MP2 tends to undercorrelate weakly
               polarizable systems and overcorrelates strongly polarizable
               systems. As a result, lattice constants are overestimated for
               large gap systems and underestimated for small gap systems. The
               volume dependence of the MP2 correlation energy and the
               dependence of the MP2 band gaps on the static dielectric
               screening properties are discussed in detail. Moreover, the
               relationship between MP2 and the G0W0 quasiparticle energies is
               elucidated and discussed. Finally, we demonstrate explicitly that
               the correlation energy diverges with decreasing k-point spacing
               for metals.",
