               excited states requires a larger effort than ground-state
               calculations, which can be very efficiently carried out within
               density-functional theory. On the other hand, two theoretical and
               computational tools have come to prominence for the description
               of electronic excitations. One of them, many-body perturbation
               theory, is based on a set of Green's-function equations, starting
               with a one-electron propagator and considering the electron-hole
               Green's function for the response. Key ingredients are the
               electron's self-energy \ensuremath{\Sigma} and the electron-hole
               interaction. A good approximation for \ensuremath{\Sigma} is
               obtained with Hedin's $\mathrm{GW}$ approach, using
               density-functional theory as a zero-order solution.
               First-principles $\mathrm{GW}$ calculations for real systems have
               been successfully carried out since the 1980s. Similarly, the
               electron-hole interaction is well described by the Bethe-Salpeter
               equation, via a functional derivative of \ensuremath{\Sigma}. An
               alternative approach to calculating electronic excitations is the
               time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), which offers
               the important practical advantage of a dependence on density
               rather than on multivariable Green's functions. This approach
               leads to a screening equation similar to the Bethe-Salpeter one,
               but with a two-point, rather than a four-point, interaction
               kernel. At present, the simple adiabatic local-density
               approximation has given promising results for finite systems, but
               has significant deficiencies in the description of absorption
               spectra in solids, leading to wrong excitation energies, the
               absence of bound excitonic states, and appreciable distortions of
               the spectral line shapes. The search for improved TDDFT
               potentials and kernels is hence a subject of increasing interest.
               It can be addressed within the framework of many-body
               perturbation theory: in fact, both the Green's functions and the
               TDDFT approaches profit from mutual insight. This review compares
               the theoretical and practical aspects of the two approaches and
               their specific numerical implementations, and presents an
               overview of accomplishments and work in progress.",

               be viewed as an exact reformulation of time-dependent quantum
               mechanics, where the fundamental variable is no longer the
               many-body wave function but the density. This time-dependent
               density is determined by solving an auxiliary set of
               noninteracting Schrödinger equations, the Kohn-Sham equations.
               The nontrivial part of the many-body interaction is contained in
               the so-called exchange-correlation potential, for which
               reasonably good approximations exist. Within TDDFT two regimes
               can be distinguished: (a) If the external time-dependent
               potential is “small,” the complete numerical solution of the
               time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations can be avoided by the use of
               linear response theory. This is the case, e.g., for the
               calculation of photoabsorption spectra. (b) For a “strong”
               external potential, a full solution of the time-dependent
               Kohn-Sham equations is in order. This situation is encountered,
               for instance, when matter interacts with intense laser fields. In

               foundations to several applications both in the linear and in the

               systematically approximate the excitation energies of GW theory.
               This is achieved by rigorously expanding the self-energy in order
               to exactly conserve a desired number of frequency-independent
               moments of the self-energy dynamics. Recasting GW in this way
               admits a low-scaling O[N4] approach to build and solve this
               Hamiltonian, with a proposal to reduce this further to O[N3].
               This relies on exposing a novel recursive framework for the
               density response moments of the random phase approximation, where
               the efficient calculation of its starting point mirrors the
               low-scaling approaches to compute RPA correlation energies. The
               frequency integration of GW, which distinguishes so many
               different GW variants, can be performed without approximation
               directly in this moment representation. Furthermore, the solution

                   \emph{ab initio} computational methods for molecules and
                   materials. However, this perturbation expansion can break

                   occurs in many scenarios such as the bond dissociation of
                   molecules in chemical reactions. In this work, we developed a
                   generalized (time-dependent) MBPT for computing electron
                   correlation energies, in which the zeroth-order Hamiltonian
                   can be interacting and hence the zeroth-order reference state
                   is a multi-determinant wavefunction instead of a single
                   Slater determinant in general. This allows us to take strong
                   correlation into account from the outset and treat the
                   residual weak interaction by diagrammatic perturbation
                   expansion. Using this framework, we formulated a

                   leads to a set of unified equations that work in both SR and

                   many plane-wave formulations. Finite size corrections are
                   included by taking the $q \to 0$ limit of the Coulomb
                   divergence. Using our implementation, we study quasiparticle
                   energies and band structures across a range of systems
                   including molecules, semiconductors, rare gas solids, and
                   metals. We find that the $G_0W_0$ band gaps of traditional
                   semiconductors converge rapidly with respect to the basis
                   size, even for the conventionally challenging case of ZnO.
                   Using correlation-consistent bases of polarized triple-zeta
                   quality, we find the mean absolute relative error of the
                   extrapolated $G_0W_0$@PBE band gaps to be only 5.2\% when
                   compared to experimental values. For core excitation binding
                   energies (CEBEs), we find that $G_0W_0$ predictions improve
                   significantly over those from DFT if the $G_0W_0$
                   calculations are started from hybrid functionals with a high
                   percentage of exact exchange.",

               time correlation functions of many-body condensed phase quantum
               systems is one of the outstanding problems in theoretical
               chemistry. The Nakajima-Zwanzig-Mori formalism coupled to the
               self-consistent solution of the memory kernel has recently proven
               to be highly successful for the computation of nonequilibrium
               dynamical averages. Here, we extend this formalism to treat
               symmetrized equilibrium time correlation functions for the
               spin-boson model. Following the first paper in this series [A.
               Montoya-Castillo and D. R. Reichman, J. Chem. Phys. 144, 184104
               (2016)], we use a Dyson-type expansion of the projected
               propagator to obtain a self-consistent solution for the memory
               kernel that requires only the calculation of normally evolved
               auxiliary kernels. We employ the approximate mean-field Ehrenfest
               method to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Via
               comparison with numerically exact results for the correlation
               function Czz(t)=Re⟨σz(0)σz(t)⟩, we show that the current scheme
               affords remarkable boosts in accuracy and efficiency over bare
               Ehrenfest dynamics. We further explore the sensitivity of the
               resulting dynamics to the choice of kernel closures and the
               accuracy of the initial canonical density operator.",

                   correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently
                   calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant
                   challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics
                   of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel
                   coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating
                   TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for
                   TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into
                   auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us
                   to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high
                   accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient
                   as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is
                   general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a

                   operators. Indeed, unlike most previous literature on the

                   electronic Green's function. We demonstrate the method by

               approximate a numerically challenging frequency integral; the
               integral can be performed analytically, but doing so leads to an
               expensive implementation whose computational cost scales as
               O(N6), where N is the size of the system. Here, we introduce a
               new formulation of the full-frequency GW approximation by exactly
               recasting it as an eigenvalue problem in an expanded space. This
               new formulation (1) avoids the use of time or frequency grids,
               (2) naturally obviates the need for the common ``diagonal''
               approximation, (3) enables common iterative eigensolvers that
               reduce the canonical scaling to O(N5), and (4) enables a
               density-fitted implementation that reduces the scaling to O(N4).
               We numerically verify these scaling behaviors and test a variety
               of approximations that are motivated by this new formulation. The
               new formulation is found to be competitive with conventional
               O(N4) methods based on analytic continuation or contour

	abstract = {The GW approximation in electronic structure theory has become a widespread tool for predicting electronic excitations in chemical compounds and materials. In the realm of theoretical spectroscopy, the GW method provides access to charged excitations as measured in direct or inverse photoemission spectroscopy. The number of GW calculations in the past two decades has exploded with increased computing power and modern codes. The success of GW can be attributed to many factors: favorable scaling with respect to system size, a formal interpretation for charged excitation energies, the importance of dynamical screening in real systems, and its practical combination with other theories. In this review, we provide an overview of these formal and practical considerations. We expand, in detail, on the choices presented to the scientist performing GW calculations for the first time. We also give an introduction to the many-body theory behind GW, a review of modern applications like molecules and surfaces, and a perspective on methods which go beyond conventional GW calculations. This review addresses chemists, physicists and material scientists with an interest in theoretical spectroscopy. It is intended for newcomers to GW calculations but can also serve as an alternative perspective for experts and an up-to-date source of computational techniques.},
