Dear Members of the HOUSE_NAME Resident Tutor Selection Committee,

I am a PhD candidate in Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard, and I am writing to express my interest in joining the [HOUSE NAME] community as a Resident Tutor. My professional background is as a researcher and mentor. My personal background is as a stroke and cancer survivor. These experiences have imbued in me a unique perspective that will allow me to support the students at HOUSE_NAME House in their academic and personal growth.

 I have developed an expertise in the practice and communication of science. I have spent most of my life as a researcher in quantum chemistry; this field is highly interdisciplinary, with a foot in physics, chemistry, computer science, and applied mathematics. Additionally, I am able to operate outside my area of expertise. As a member of the Harvard Energy Journal Club, I have given presentations on the energy demands of AI, carbon taxation, and climate tipping points; as a Teaching Fellow for Physical Sciences 11, I learned to relay general chemistry concepts to students from diverse academic backgrounds. These experiences have prepared me to mentor students pursuing all kinds of science disciplines at HOUSE_NAME House.

I am uniquely qualified to support students in their personal journeys. 4 years ago, I couldn't move in a hospital bed, but now I am pursuing a PhD at Harvard. This would not have been possible without learning how to strike the balance between academic ambition and self care. Even today, I interpolate my work hours between programming and doing physical therapy exercises. This experience has prepared me to support students achieve whatever success means to them. 

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to join [HOUSE NAME] because of its [SPECIFIC REASON: e.g., advising philosophy, traditions, community values, academic support programs, cultural life, etc.]. I am inspired by the House’s commitment to [INSERT VALUE], and I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to programming that promotes community-building, belonging, and academic growth. I would look forward to collaborating with the House team to foster an inclusive, supportive environment in which all students can thrive both personally and intellectually.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to contribute to the HOUSE NAME House community as a Resident Tutor and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and values align with the House’s mission. I appreciate your time and look forward to the possibility of joining your community.

Sincerely,  
**Patryk Kozlowski**
