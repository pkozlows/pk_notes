Dear Members of the Winthrop House Resident Tutor Selection Committee,

I am a PhD candidate in Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard, and I am writing to express my interest in joining the Winthrop House community as a Resident Tutor. My professional background is as a researcher and mentor. My personal background is as a stroke and cancer survivor. These experiences have imbued in me a unique perspective that will allow me to support the students at Winthrop House in their academic and personal growth.

 I have developed an expertise in the practice and communication of science. I have spent most of my life as a researcher in quantum chemistry; this field is highly interdisciplinary, with a foot in physics, chemistry, computer science, and applied mathematics. Additionally, I am able to operate outside my area of expertise. As a member of the Harvard Energy Journal Club (HEJC), I have given presentations on the energy demands of AI, carbon taxation, and climate tipping points; as a Teaching Fellow for Physical Sciences 11, I have learned to relay complex chemistry concepts to students from diverse academic backgrounds. These experiences have prepared me to mentor students pursuing all kinds of scientific disciplines at Winthrop House.

I am uniquely qualified to support students in their personal journeys. After I suffered a stroke four years ago, I could not move in my hospital bed, but now I am pursuing a PhD at Harvard. This would not have been possible without learning how to strike the balance between academic ambition and self care. Every week, I interpolate my work hours between programming and doing physical therapy exercises. This experience has prepared me to support students in achieving their personal definitions of success.

I am drawn to Winthrop House due to its rich history. Among its notable alumni is Mark Carney, prime minister of Canada. Unfortunately, the current political climate has led him to repeal Canada's pioneering carbon tax, which I am a strong proponent of, having researched this topic for my HEJC presentation. However, I admire how he has been able to navigate political adversity, ranging from the pressures of tariffs from the Trump administration to the rise of right-wing populism at home.

Thank you for considering my application and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and values align with the House’s mission.

Sincerely,  
**Patryk Kozlowski**
