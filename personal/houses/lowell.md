Dear Members of the Lowell House Resident Tutor Selection Committee,

I am a PhD candidate in Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard, and I am writing to express my interest in joining the Lowell House community as a Resident Tutor. My professional background is as a researcher and mentor. My personal background is as a stroke and cancer survivor. These experiences have imbued in me a unique perspective that will allow me to support the students at Lowell House in their academic and personal growth.

 I have developed an expertise in the practice and communication of science. I have spent most of my life as a researcher in quantum chemistry; this field is highly interdisciplinary, with a foot in physics, chemistry, computer science, and applied mathematics. Additionally, I am able to operate outside my area of expertise. As a member of the Harvard Energy Journal Club, I have given presentations on the energy demands of AI, carbon taxation, and climate tipping points; as a Teaching Fellow for Physical Sciences 11, I have learned to relay complex chemistry concepts to students from diverse academic backgrounds. These experiences have prepared me to mentor students pursuing all kinds of scientific disciplines at Lowell House.

I am uniquely qualified to support students in their personal journeys. After I suffered a stroke four years ago, I could not move in my hospital bed, but now I am pursuing a PhD at Harvard. This would not have been possible without learning how to strike the balance between academic ambition and self care. Every week, I interpolate my work hours between programming and doing physical therapy exercises. This experience has prepared me to support students in achieving their personal definitions of success.

I am drawn to Lowell House due to its rich history. Among its notable alumni is Chris Wallace. I admire him as a journalist who has strived to be nonpartisan, in an era of increasing polarization in the media. I remember him most as the first Fox News journalist to moderate a presidential debate in 2016 and he went on to moderate another debate in 2020 as well.

Thank you for considering my application and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and values align with the House’s mission.

Sincerely,  
**Patryk Kozlowski**
